# Tab To Window

Chrome extension to move the current tab to a new window using the command API

Position of window can be changed via options

Key command can be changed via chrome://extensions 'Configure commands'

## TODO

	* Restore focus to original window (option?)
	* Restoring options updates GUI
	* GUI affects controls and vice versa
